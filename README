Here are a bunch of my answers for Project Euler.  Most old ones are done in Python, although some, that I no longer have the code for, were done in Java.  Some of these are going for speed, others are going for shortest code.

Right now, I'm doing them in Ruby, so that's what any new ones will be in.
