Putting all my answers to project euler on here.  Did a lot of these a long time ago and don't have the code any more so I might redo some of them, now that I have a better knowledge of Python.
I'm currently attempting to solve these in as short of code as I can, rather than going for speed.  Keep in mind, these one-liners aren't necessarily aiming for speed, but rather just for shortness.
Later on, I may come back and do a solution with the fastest code, and then solution with both fast and short code.
